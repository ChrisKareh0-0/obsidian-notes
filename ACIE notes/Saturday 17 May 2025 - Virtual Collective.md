> **‚ÄúCan we make money AND improve the world?‚Äù**

- **Environmental or social impact**?
    

**Examples:**

- A solar energy company helps reduce emissions **and** earns money.
    
- A recycling startup turns waste into products, creating jobs **and** value.
    

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Profit Reinvestment for Impact

> Can part of your profits be redirected to serve:

- Employees or cooperative members?
    
- The wellbeing of the local community?
    
- Environmental causes (e.g. tree planting, ocean cleanup)?
    

**Idea**: Embed **impact as a business function**, not an afterthought.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Choosing a Mission-Aligned Legal Structure

> Will your business adopt a legal form that reflects its purpose?

**Legal Forms to Consider:**

- **Social Enterprise**: For-profit with a mission focus
    
- **B Corp**: Certified companies balancing profit and purpose
    
- **Cooperative**: Owned by workers or users, democratic control
    
- **Non-Profit**: Revenue goes back into the mission

    Impact investors and ESG funds actively seek dual-purpose ventures.
    
4. **Resilience & Sustainability**  
    Purpose-driven businesses are better at long-term thinking and risk management.
