- Describe the potential for machine learning in underutilized markets
## What is machine learning ?
Machine learning (ML) is the process of training computers, using math and statistical processes, to find and recognize patterns in data. After patterns are found ML generated and updates training models to make increasingly accurate predictions and inferences about future outcomes based on historical and new data. For example, ML could help determine the likelihood of a customer purchasing a particular product based on previous purchases by the user or the product's past sales history.
Building ML applications is an iterative process that involves a sequence of steps. To build an Ml application, follow these general steps:
