Yes, in many cases, employers can offer support for accommodation, especially if they are hiring international talent and understand the relocation challenges. This can vary based on the employer's policies, the role, and the company's relocation package. Here are some common options employers may provide:

1. **Temporary Accommodation**: Some employers offer temporary housing for the first few weeks or months, allowing you time to find permanent accommodation.

2. **Housing Allowance**: Some companies provide a monthly housing allowance as part of the employment package, which can help cover rental costs.

3. **Assistance with Finding Housing**: Employers may assist with finding suitable accommodation by connecting you with local rental agencies or offering advice on where to look.

4. **Full Accommodation Coverage**: In rare cases, employers may provide a fully covered, long-term housing option, although this is less common and generally reserved for senior positions or specialized roles.

Itâ€™s best to discuss these options with the employer during the hiring process, especially if accommodation is a deciding factor for you.
