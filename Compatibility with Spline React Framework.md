Considering alternatives to Next.js due to challenges with Server/Client Component separation in the `app` directory and `async/await` limitations in Client Components.

## Framework Options:

### 1. [[Remix]]

*   **Focus:** Full-stack web framework built on Web Fetch API and [[React Router]]. Emphasizes nested routing, data loading, and mutations.
*   **Server/Client Model:** Less restrictive than Next.js's `app` directory. Allows `async/await` in "loaders" (server-side data-fetching functions). Offers flexibility in combining server and client rendering.
*   **Data Fetching:** Loaders run on the server, fetching data before rendering (similar to `getServerSideProps` in Next.js's `pages`, but more integrated with routing).
*   **Hydration:** Handles hydration well, reducing potential errors.

**Why [[Remix]] might be a good alternative:**

*   Integrated approach to routing, data fetching, and mutations.
*   `async/await` for server-side data loading without Next.js Server Component restrictions.
*   Less concern about SEO from static site generation (SSG); comfortable with server-side rendering (SSR).

### 2. [[Gatsby]]

*   **Focus:** Primarily a static site generator (SSG), but supports server-side rendering (SSR) and deferred static generation (DSG).
*   **Data Layer:** GraphQL data layer for pulling data from various sources (CMS, APIs, files) during build.
*   **Plugins:** Extensive plugin ecosystem for data integration and added functionality.
*   **Client-Side Rendering:** Initially renders on the client after HTML loads. Prefetches data for linked pages to improve performance.

**Why [[Gatsby]] might be a good alternative:**

*   Mostly static content.
*   Multiple data sources; using GraphQL for data management.
*   Large plugin ecosystem.
*   Less suitable for highly dynamic, frequently changing content.

### 3. [[Create React App (CRA)]] + Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Setup

*   **Focus:** Bootstraps client-side rendered React apps. Simple, less opinionated structure.
*   **SSR (Optional):** Add SSR using libraries like `react-dom/server` and Express.js for full control over server rendering.
*   **Flexibility:** Maximum flexibility but requires manual setup, especially for SSR.

**Why [[CRA]] + SSR might be a good alternative:**

*   Full control over server-side rendering.
*   Less opinionated framework.
*   Comfortable with manual SSR setup.
*   Simpler approach without Next.js `app` directory complexities.

### 4. [[Vite]] + React + SSR

*   **[[Vite]]:** Fast build tool using native ES modules. Plugin system for extending functionality.
*   **React + SSR:** Combine [[Vite]] with libraries like `react-dom/server` for SSR.
*   **Performance:** Excellent performance in development and production.

**Why [[Vite]] + React + SSR might be a good alternative:**

*   Fast, performant development experience.
*   Flexible, less opinionated build tool than [[CRA]].
*   Comfortable with manual SSR setup.

## Choosing the Right Framework:

Selection depends on project requirements and preferences:

*   **[[Next.js]]**: Still powerful for SEO, SSG, or combined SSR/SSG. Use `pages` directory or adapt to Server/Client model in `app`.
*   **[[Remix]]**: Ideal for integrated routing, data loading, mutations, and a flexible server/client model.
*   **[[Gatsby]]**: Best for mostly static sites, especially with multiple data sources and GraphQL.
*   **[[CRA]] or [[Vite]] + SSR**: For maximum flexibility, full control over SSR, and a less opinionated approach.

**Recommendation:**

Experiment with a simple project using one or two frameworks to determine the best fit.
