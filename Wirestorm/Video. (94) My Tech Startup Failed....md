### Key Lessons from a Failed Tech Startup:

1. **Validate Your Idea Early**  
   - Don’t just assume your idea is good. Talk to potential users, gather feedback, and ensure there’s demand before investing time and money.
   
2. **Keep it Simple**  
   - Start with the smallest viable version of your product. Don’t over-engineer; build just enough to test your concept and get user feedback.

3. **Release Early, Iterate Quickly**  
   - Don’t wait for a perfect product. Release a basic version to users, gather feedback, and continuously improve based on real-world use.

4. **Detach Ego from the Product**  
   - Accept criticism and use it to improve. Don’t tie your self-worth to your work—focus on making the product better.

5. **Fail Fast**  
   - If something isn’t working, pivot or shut it down quickly. Don’t waste time holding onto something that’s not viable.
