## **2. Key Concepts (With Visual Metaphors)**

### **A. Center Control**

Controlling the center (e4, d4, e5, d5) is like **owning the main roads** of a city.

```
Center Squares:
    c  d  e  f
4 | .  #  #  .
5 | .  #  #  .
```

Pieces placed here have **maximum mobility** and **control the board**.

---

### **B. Development**

Good: Develop knights and bishops quickly.

Bad: Moving pawns and queen too early.

```
Early Good Development:
    a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h
8 | r  n  b  q  k  b  n  r
7 | p  p  p  p  p  p  p  p
6 | .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
5 | .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
4 | .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
3 | .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
2 | P  P  P  P  P  P  P  P
1 | R  N  B  Q  K  B  N  R
```

After 1. e4 and 2. Nf3 — you’re developing while controlling the center.
