# 📜 Entered Apprentice Study Roadmap

---

## **Step 1: Orientation & Foundations**

**Objective:** Understand what the First Degree represents in broad strokes.

- 📖 _Read:_ Carl Claudy, _Introduction to Freemasonry, Vol. 1 (Entered Apprentice)_ – short, clear, and tailored to new Masons.
    
- 🧭 _Focus on:_ What “light” means in Masonry; the journey from darkness to illumination.
    
- ❓ _Reflection Question:_ _Where in my own life do I feel I am still “in darkness,” and what would it mean to seek “light” there?_
    

---

## **Step 2: Symbols of the Degree**

**Objective:** Learn the working tools and lodge symbols, and think about their moral meaning.

- 📖 _Read:_ Sections in Claudy’s book about the **24-inch gauge, common gavel, and chisel**.
    
- 📖 _Supplement:_ W.L. Wilmshurst, _The Meaning of Masonry_ (chapter on the Entered Apprentice).
    
- 🔨 _Focus on:_
    
    - 24-inch gauge = use of time.
        
    - Common gavel = breaking off bad habits.
        
    - Rough & Perfect Ashlar = self-improvement.
        
- ❓ _Reflection Question:_ _If my character is the “rough ashlar,” what specific habit or trait should I start “chipping away” first?_
    

---

## **Step 3: The Lodge as a Symbol**

**Objective:** Explore how the lodge represents the world and the path of life.

- 📖 _Read:_ Claudy’s discussion of lodge layout and positions of officers.
    
- 📚 _Optional deeper dive:_ Harry Carr, _The Freemason at Work_ (questions on lodge symbolism).
    
- 🧭 _Focus on:_ East (wisdom), South (strength), West (rest), North (darkness).
    
- ❓ _Reflection Question:_ _If I placed myself inside the symbolic lodge of my own life, where am I standing right now — in the East, South, West, or North? Why?_
    

---

## **Step 4: Moral Teachings & Virtues**

**Objective:** Grasp the practical ethical side of Masonry.

- 📖 _Read:_ Claudy’s treatment of the three principal tenets — Brotherly Love, Relief, Truth.
    
- 📖 _Supplement:_ Joseph Fort Newton, _The Builders_ (chapters on Masonic ideals).
    
- 🧭 _Focus on:_ Living Masonry outside lodge walls.
    
- ❓ _Reflection Question:_ _How do I actively practice Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth in daily life, not just in theory?_
    

---

## **Step 5: Historical & Spiritual Context**

**Objective:** Understand where Masonry came from and why Solomon’s Temple matters.

- 📖 _Read:_ Joseph Fort Newton, _The Builders_ (overview of history + Temple of Solomon).
    
- 📖 _Optional advanced:_ Pike’s _Morals and Dogma_ (Entered Apprentice section only — read slowly!).
    
- 🧭 _Focus on:_ Masonry as a _continuation of humanity’s search for truth and moral building._
    
- ❓ _Reflection Question:_ _Why do you think Masonry uses the building of Solomon’s Temple as a metaphor for building oneself?_
    

---

## **Step 6: Contemplation & Dialogue**

**Objective:** Transform study into personal growth.

- 💬 Discuss your reflections with your mentor or lodge brethren.
    
- 📝 Keep a private “Masonic journal” where you record thoughts on symbols, obligations, and virtues.
    
- 🙏 Meditate briefly before or after study — Masonry values contemplation as much as reading.
