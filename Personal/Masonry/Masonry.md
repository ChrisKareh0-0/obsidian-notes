Freemasonry (or the Freemasons) is one of the world's oldest and largest fraternal organizations. It dates back to at least the early 1700s in its modern form, though it claims symbolic roots in the medieval stonemason guilds.

### What Is Freemasonry?

At its core, Freemasonry is a **fraternity** or **brotherhood** that emphasizes:

- **Moral development**
- **Charity and community service**
- **Personal growth**
- **Brotherhood and mutual support**
- **Philosophical and symbolic teachings**

It is **not a religion**, but it requires members to believe in a higher power (often called the "Great Architect of the Universe").

### What Do Freemasons Do?

1. **Meet in lodges**: Members gather in groups called "lodges," where they conduct rituals, hold discussions, and work on charitable projects.
2. **Perform rituals**: These are symbolic ceremonies based on allegories from architecture, especially building Solomon’s Temple.
3. **Charity work**: Freemasons contribute a lot to local and national charitable causes.
4. **Mentorship and networking**: Members support each other’s personal and professional development.
5. **Study symbolism and philosophy**: Freemasonry uses symbols (like the square and compass) to teach lessons about ethics, responsibility, and life.

### Is It Secret?

Freemasonry is not exactly "secret," but it's **private**. Some of their rituals, symbols, and handshake greetings are known only to members, which is why people sometimes think it's mysterious or conspiratorial.

### **1. Officially – The Public Face**

The ultimate goal, according to Freemasons themselves, is:

- **Moral and spiritual improvement** of the individual.
- **Creating better men** who then help build a better society.
- **Serving humanity** through charity, community work, and integrity.

They use architecture (like building Solomon’s Temple) as symbolic language to describe "building oneself" into a better person.

### **2. Esoteric Side – The Hidden Layers**

Now here's where things get deeper.

Freemasonry is full of **symbols, allegories, and rituals**—often borrowed from **Hermeticism, Kabbalah, ancient Egypt, Rosicrucianism, and alchemy**. These aren't just for show.

Their **deeper goal**, esoterically, is about:

- **Inner transformation**
- **Achieving "light" or enlightenment**
- **Understanding hidden truths of the universe, self, and God**
- **Transcending the material world**

They use **degrees** (like Apprentice, Fellowcraft, Master Mason) to symbolize stages of spiritual awakening.

### **3. The Secrets**

There are no “one big secret” kind of answers, but here’s what’s often talked about:

- **Lost Word of God**: One of their central mysteries is the quest to rediscover a "lost word" or divine name, symbolizing ultimate truth.
- **Hiram Abiff**: A central figure in their ritual mythology, said to have taken the secrets of the temple to the grave, implying the soul’s journey to enlightenment.
- **The Temple of Solomon**: Symbolizes the human body or soul, and building it represents spiritual perfection.
- **The All-Seeing Eye**: Represents divine insight, omniscience, and spiritual watchfulness.

### **4. Conspiracy Theories – (for curiosity’s sake)**

A lot of mystery around Freemasonry comes from what outsiders _think_ it’s doing:

- **New World Order**: Some believe they secretly control global politics, banking, media, etc.
- **Luciferian Symbolism**: Due to the misunderstood use of light, some accuse them of worshipping Lucifer (though in Masonic terms, "light" means knowledge).
- **Occult rituals**: The secrecy and ritualistic nature lead people to think they’re hiding something dark.
- **Elite networks**: It’s true that historically, many powerful figures (presidents, kings, bankers) were Masons, so some think it’s a tool of global elites.

_But most actual Masons would say that’s Hollywood fiction._

### **Freemasonry Degrees (Main Rituals)**

There are three primary degrees in what's called "Blue Lodge" Masonry (the foundation of Freemasonry):

---

## **1. Entered Apprentice**

**Theme:** Birth / Initiation / New beginning

**Ritual Highlights:**

- The candidate is **blindfolded (hoodwinked)** and led by a rope (cable tow), symbolizing ignorance and dependence.
- He is asked to **knock three times** at the door, representing the desire for knowledge.
- He’s partially **exposed** (one sleeve rolled up, one pant leg rolled, chest bare)—symbolizing vulnerability and readiness to receive “light.”
- After taking oaths of secrecy and morality, the blindfold is removed and he sees “light,” symbolizing spiritual awakening.

**Symbolism:**

- Entering the world of deeper knowledge.
- Death of ignorance and the beginning of inner work.

---

## **2. Fellowcraft**

**Theme:** Education / Development of the mind and soul

**Ritual Highlights:**

- The candidate learns about the **seven liberal arts and sciences**: grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic, geometry, music, astronomy.
- He’s introduced to the concept of **Jacob’s Ladder**, **the Middle Chamber**, and **the winding staircase**—all symbols of the soul’s climb toward enlightenment.
- A focus on the **working tools of a Mason**, like the square and compasses, used allegorically for moral and spiritual life.

**Symbolism:**

- Advancement through knowledge.
- Refinement of both intellectual and spiritual faculties.

---

## **3. Master Mason**

**Theme:** Death, resurrection, immortality of the soul

**Ritual Highlights:**

- The candidate re-enacts the death of **Hiram Abiff**, the legendary builder of Solomon’s Temple who is murdered for refusing to reveal secret knowledge.
- He is **"buried" and then raised** again by the "Lion's Paw" grip (a special handshake), symbolizing rebirth or spiritual resurrection.
- The drama teaches the idea that truth and virtue survive beyond death.

**Symbolism:**

- Facing death and overcoming it through virtue and wisdom.
- The eternal journey of the soul.
- The search for the “Lost Word,” a symbol for divine truth.

### **Other Masonic Bodies & Degrees**

Beyond these 3 degrees, there are _many_ higher degrees in other branches:

- **Scottish Rite** (degrees 4–32): Deals heavily in mystical philosophy, Kabbalah, and symbolic interpretations of biblical and esoteric texts.
- **York Rite**: Focuses more on Christian-oriented teachings.
- **33rd Degree (Scottish Rite)**: Honorary, often misunderstood as some secret power level—mostly symbolic recognition of service.

---

### **Common Ritual Elements:**

- **Oaths and penalties** (used to be very dramatic, like “having your tongue cut out”—but mostly symbolic now).
- **Secret words and grips** (handshakes) to identify rank and initiate trust.
- **Tracing boards** (symbolic paintings used during rituals).
- **Sacred Geometry**: The use of shapes and architecture to reflect universal laws.
